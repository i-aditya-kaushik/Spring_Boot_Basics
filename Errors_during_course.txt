Config errors and suggestions
-----------------------------
1. .ini file in the STS folder defines the initial config of the STS.
2. The heap error might arise. In order to solve the error, one may:
i. either include _JAVA_OPTIONS environ var
and set the value as -Xmx2g, where XMX means max cap of the heap and 2g is the space, 2g = 2gb (one can also 
define with m, which is mb)
ii. Go to Run->Run Configurations then under arguments set the VM Arguments as -Xmx2g and save.
3. FYI, there is another arg as Xms, which is the minimum space of the heap. eg: -Xms1g

Web application and backend errors
----------------------------------
4. In order to include template jsp, xml or other web resources: i. Go to Add support help â€” install new
ii. Download Web, XML, Java EE and OSGi Enterprise Development

5. spring.jpa.defer-datasource-initialization = true must be set in application.properties in order to enable 
initialization of the db, else, the application will give the error of table not found
