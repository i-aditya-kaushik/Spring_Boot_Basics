1. It's a good practice to separate the different filetypes in different
packages.

2. Controller needs to be set up everytime. h2 needs to be enabled with the 
help of the application.properties:
spring.h2.console.enabled=true
spring.sql.init.platform=h2
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:h2:mem:aditya
spring.sql.init.mode=always
spring.jpa.defer-datasource-initialization = true

3. The h2 console can be accessed with localhost:8080/h2-console

4. JPA needs to be enabled to make a table, for which we need to call the class as 
a @Entity with a primary key marked as @Id

5. To create a new row using home.jsp, we need to first define the form function in 
Controller.java and then we need to define an interface and extend the CrudRepository. 
Thereafter, we need to call the class, in our case Alien and the ID needs to be defined,
in our case, Integer.

6. The interface needs to be called inside the Controller, and needs to be autowired.
